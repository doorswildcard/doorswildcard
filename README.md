Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Ilan but I go by Bob.

I'm currently working on polishing my skills as a programmer by building my fundamentals.
I can be extremely passionate and ambitious about projects that are very challenging for me.
I'm currently learning JavaScript and Python along with React and Flask and soon Django.
I am very rusty with Java and Lua.
Any advice on how to become a better software engineer is welcome!

You can reach out to me at 917-600-1495
